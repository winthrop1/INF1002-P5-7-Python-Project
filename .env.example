# ========== DEPLOYMENT MODE TOGGLE ==========
# Controls whether app runs in local mode (full features) or serverless mode (graceful degradation)
#
# USE_SERVERLESS_MODE Options:
#   false (default) = LOCAL MODE
#     - Loads ham dataset (2,801 emails, 19MB)
#     - Extracts 581 safe email domains
#     - Stores analysis results to dataset/safe_keep/
#     - Shows real analytics in admin dashboard
#
#   true = SERVER MODE (simulates Vercel deployment locally)
#     - Uses 26 pre-defined common safe domains
#     - Disables file storage
#     - Shows dummy data in admin dashboard
#     - Reduces deployment size
#
# NOTE: On Vercel, this is automatically set to 'true' via VERCEL env variable
